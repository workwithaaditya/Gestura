# Place the gesture_recognizer.task file here

Download the MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer model from:
https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/gesture_recognizer

Expected filename:
`gesture_recognizer.task`

The Next.js app will load it from `/models/gesture_recognizer.task` (which maps to this folder in production).
